# Find Me A Gift!

Well, here we go with the first attempt at a large scale project that I intend
to finish in some sort of describable time frame.

## Build

This can be pulled and rebuildt in Android Studio with the Flutter framework.

I am using a Google Nexus 2 running Android 9 as an emulator for this project.
